Overview
========
This demo examples is used to demonstrate a NFC data transfert through the NTAG SRAM. 
This demo has to be used with the ntag_demo.
For more information, please check the ntag_demo readme.txt file.

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso

Hardware requirements
=====================
- 1 Mini USB cable
- 1 OM15076-3 Carrier Board (DK6 board)
- 1 OM5578/PN7150S (NFC reader) extension board to be plugged on the OM15076-3 Carrier Board
- 1 JN/QN/K32W Module to be plugged on the Carrier Board


Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board. 
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
This demo has to be used with the ntag_demo to demonstrate a SRAM data transfert.
